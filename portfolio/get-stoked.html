        <p class="lead">
          Get Stoked is a swim program that emphasizes personalization, patience, love of water, and safety, and is owned and operated by the swim instructor, Billy. Our team redesigned his website to accurately reflect his level of experience and qualifications, as well as incorporate new features that increased efficiency on both the customer's end and Billy's end.

        <h6>Challenge</h6>
        <p class="lead">
          Though the business goals of this project include 3 new features, we uncovered a larger issue our target audience had with the current website. Parents want a swim instructor that they can trust with their kids, and the current Get Stoked website doesn’t accurately portray Billy’s level of experience with kids and expertise in water safety.
        </p>
        <h6>Solution</h6>
        <p class="lead">
          Create a more robust front page for Get Stoked that includes Billy's teaching experience and qualifications, and build an account portal for customers so they can schedule lessons, make payments, and view lesson progress.
        </p>
        <h6>Team</h6>
        <p class="lead">
          I collaborated with Laura Podsiadlo and Armond Tsaturyan. We each contributed to the research, ideation, prototyping, and usability testing. As we reached the design phase, I spearheaded the mobile prototype, Laura brought to life the desktop prototype, and Armond lead the usability tests.

          With a solid understanding of our stakeholder's business goals, we began examining the current Get Stoked website for usability problems using established heuristic principles as well as contextual inquiries with users. We also conducted interviews with users in our target demographic to get a sense of what is most important to them when looking for a swim instructor for their kids.

                      As a small business owner, Billy needs a responsive website that integrates payment, scheduling, and a customer account portal that is easy to use both on his end as well as the user's end.

                    In order to gain insight into what customers want to see on their ideal swim instructor's website, we conducted interviews with 6 different people within the target audience of Get Stoked -  parents with at least one child within the 2-5 age range. One of the most important questions we asked during the interviews was What qualities do you look for in a swimming instructor? The top answers we received included experience, safety, responsible, and patient – all things that Billy's instruction completely embodies.

                      However, when we then asked the same group of parents to test out Billy's current site, they did not feel that it provided enough information about Billy himself or his teaching methodology. We discovered that the information most desired by the user was absent from not only the homepage, but the entire website. Unsatisfied with the information presented, each user would eventually leave the website feeling too skeptical about the company to continue.

                        The final prototypes were tested and iterated until all pain points were resolved. Some of the final changes we made based on user feedback included:

                      For future iterations, we would like to undertake more user testing on the messaging feature for early check-in according to feedback we received. We would also like to perform Red Route analysis to find common user patterns for the rest of the app.
