                    Revision is a hardware solutions provider specializing in military-grade protective equipment, power management, and integrated systems. 
                    Revision recognized that today's soldiers were in need of an eco-friendly power solution that is optimized for a soldier’s day-to-day use. As a result,
                    they created the rechargable, versatile, and bomb-proof SharePack battery. All the battery was missing was a companion app to control it.

                <p class="lead">
                        The battery’s innovation and ease of use was hindered only by the tiny interface built into’s it’s front panel. Soldiers 
                        were having a hard time accessing the small screen while wearing the battery as a part of their gear. 
                </p>
                <h6>Solution</h6>
                <p class="lead">
                        For maximum flexibility, we decided to create a mobile and tablet experience that allows a soldier to control the battery from 
                        the palm of their hand, without ever having to adjust the physical battery’s position. Since the military provides the soldiers with Samsung devices,
                        we determined the format should be Android only.

                            Understanding the soldiers' needs and the use cases for the battery's remote app was essential. In order to validate our assumptions and narrow down 
                            the MVP feature set, we traveled to a US Air Force Base to test out our lean prototype. There, we conducted user interviews, contextual inquiry, and 
                            several feature prioritizing exercises - including the $100 test and Kano model - before performing task analyses on the prototype with the soliders. 
                            While unpacking all the feedback we received, we found an MVP starting to take shape.

                        </h2>
                        <p class="lead">
                            User interviews and contextual inquiry revealed that during a mission, the soldiers use their smart devices in landscape mode. The vests they wear 
                            have a special compartment in the front that holds their device horizontally, and allows the soldiers to have hands-free access to it. This feedback
                            helped us understand the need for the app to support both portrait and landscape orientation.
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead">
                            While testing the prototype, soldiers emphasized the importance of push notifications generated by the app. Once on the field, the soldiers did not want to switch over to
                            the Revision app to check on the battery. More time spent in the Revision app means less time in their military apps, which help them navigate their positions and track targets.
                            We worked with the soldiers and the Revision team to hone in on which types of alerts should be pushed.

                            Some of our initial assumptions about the app's potential feature set were incorrect. During the $100 test we conducted with the soldiers, our ideas for a 
                            "stealth mode" and "auto shut-off power to ports" were nixed. The use cases we has reasoned for those features ended up being common or important enough to make
                             the cut for the MVP.

                                With the new companion app, the bigger screen called for more intuitive interactions, better learnability, and increased memorability. The final app design is flexible and adaptable for a soldier's day-to-day needs of controlling the battery pack. The app is compatible with any Android phone or tablet, 
                                and soldiers can fruidly switch orientations. This allows them to make changes to the battery before a mission in portrait mode, and later make tweaks on the field in landscape mode, when 
                                their phones are mounted to their vests. To further enhance the experience of using the app, our team created custom graphics to allow soldiers to quickly identify the different ports on the battery, and the pieces of equipment compatible to charge.
